    <h1>Visualizing General Relativity</h1>   
    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>
        Our project will model the black hole Sagittarius A*, with a primary focus on how light rays are realistically 
        affected by the gravitational pull of a black hole. Our ray tracing model will incorporate gravity on each ray 
        to model the black hole's Schwarzschild radius, as well as demonstrating how light reflects off of various 
        objects, such as asteroids and spacecraft, as they approach the black hole. Overall, our project will aid in 
        visualizing potential interactions in space that traditional ray tracing algorithms would struggle to accurately 
        represent.

    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
        The issue our project is trying to solve is that traditional ray tracing models assume that rays are unaffected by 
        gravity. This assumption is valid in the majority of situations, but as the scale of the environment grows, as in 
        the case with astronomical representations, this becomes further and further from the truth. Light rays that should 
        be curving due to celestial bodies instead just continue moving in a straight line, culminating in a distorted image.
    </p>
    <p>
        Solving this problem is important, as without it, physically accurate modeling of space wouldn't be possible. 
        The human perception of distant celestial objects is solely based on these reflected light rays, so to understand 
        how these objects truly look physically, a precise understanding of how light would travel through space is crucial.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this project isn't without many challenges. For one, the calculations required for each ray will be much 
        more complicated compared to the ray tracing algorithms we've previously discussed. Not only does this mean there 
        will be more complicated models involved, but the computational load to simulate the model will be much higher. To 
        solve this type of issue, it'll be necessary to come up with more optimization strategies through tactics such as 
        approximating ray paths rather than computing each one directly. 
    </p>
    <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
    <h3>What do we plan to deliver?</h3>
    <p>
        Our main deliverable is a render of ambient cosmic background light bending around the Schwarzschild radius of 
        Sagittarius A*, as shown in the image below.
    </p>
    <img src="img/Sagittarius_A.png" alt="Sagittarius A*">
    <p>
        To produce this final render, we must approach the problem from two fronts: understanding the underlying physics 
        of general relativity and implementing computational methods to apply ray tracing for accurate modeling. The main 
        physical phenomena that we plan to emulate in our project are gravitational lensing, accretion disks, and the 
        Schwarzschild radius of black holes. These phenomena act as the core deliverables that will result in ray-tracing 
        that follows Einstein's theory of relativity. 

        <br><br>

        In terms of measuring the "success" of our project, there are two main areas we are going to consider. The first is simply the generation of an image that 
        simulates the effect of a gravity around a blackhole. In order to do so, we will need to create a ray tracing algorithm that mimics the effect 
        of gravity on light. The second important aspect is establishing efficient ray tracing that can be rendered in a reasonable amount of time.
        Our system will likely contain an immense number of calculations per ray to simulate real life, meaning we need optimize our code in addition to considering
        the underlying physics.
          
    </p>
    <h3>What do we hope to deliver?</h3>
    <p>
        Once we have laid down the foundation of modelling Sagittarius A* through producing the phenomena mentioned above, 
        we hope to also include a depiction of red shifting and the doppler effect. We'd demonstrate these effects by having some 
        type of object (spacecraft or asteroid) approach the black hole, making renders at decreasing distances. The object 
        should begin to redshift, and eventually, no light would escape, and thus the object would disappear.
